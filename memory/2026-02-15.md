- Ran additional seed-robustness sweeps for r=0.03 (D=3, N=64) with seeds 11, 22, 33 using the standard grid (n_sigma=200, n_probes=30, m_lanczos=100, C_geo_steps=12). All three passed acceptance. Plateau centers: seed11 [1.347, 4.3221, 5.839], seed22 [1.3522, 4.316, 5.897], seed33 [1.3478, 4.3148, 5.9495]; peak R_gamma stayed at C_geo≈0.309 for all seeds with R_gamma≈2.545. Artifacts under outputs/nonseparable_rewire/D3_N64_r0.03_s{seed} with class_splitting.csv and updated summaries.
