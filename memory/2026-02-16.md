- Added per-run class_splitting aggregation to scripts/analyze_nonseparable_run.py and backfilled outputs/nonseparable_rewire/class_splitting_index.csv so every run is indexed with run_id, metadata, and diagnostics.
- Restored and filled docs/OBJECTIVES.md with current Capacity→Geometry priorities (Step 1 focus, Δλ obligations, guardrails, operating style).
- Made SLQ probe/Lanczos budgets N- and r-dependent in scripts/run_nonseparable_rewire_test.py plus documented the policy in docs/EXPERIMENT_NONSEPARABLE_REWIRE.md.
- Switched class-splitting post-process to enumerate every N_equiv boundary, emitted split_boundaries.json per run, and added boundary_table/stats/presence CSVs with seed-level uncertainty bars.
- Added refined C_geo bands ([0.27,0.45], [0.60,0.78]) to run_nonseparable_sweep + CLI flags so the staircase boundaries are sampled at higher resolution, and documented the workflow in docs/EXPERIMENT_NONSEPARABLE_REWIRE.md.
- Added a family=rgg option to run_nonseparable_rewire_test.py (backed by dimshift/rgg.py) so out-of-family sweeps build random geometric graphs with logged metadata + CLI radius controls.
- Ran first RGG out-of-family sweep (D=3, N=32, r=0.01, seed=42). Result: monotonicity passed but thresholds/banding failed; artifacts in outputs/nonseparable_rewire/D3_N32_r0.01_s42 with metadata.family=rgg and radius≈0.04.
- Started RGG N=32 sweeps (r=0.01 finished; r=0.03 run in progress but was interrupted by session timeout—needs rerun).
- Multiple attempts to run RGG r=0.03 (N=32) were killed before completion (signals 9); need a low-load slot or smaller grid to finish that sweep.
- Additional attempts to downscale the RGG r=0.03 sweep (n_sigma=120 and n_sigma=80 variants) were killed by the host before completion; need to run in a higher-quota slot or settle for a tiny diagnostic grid.
- Completed the tiny diagnostic RGG sweep for N=32, r=0.03 (n_sigma=40, 5 C_geo steps). Acceptance still failed (thresholds/banding), but artifacts were written under outputs/nonseparable_rewire/D3_N32_r0.03_s42 for reference.
- Fast diagnostic RGG run for r=0.03 (n_sigma=40, 6 C_geo steps) completed: acceptance still failed, d_s collapsed to ~0 beyond C≈0.24; artifacts under outputs/nonseparable_rewire/D3_N32_r0.03_s42 show the low-res grid used.
- Additional low-resolution RGG r=0.03 run (n_sigma=80, minimal grid) finished but still failed criteria; artifacts overwritten in outputs/nonseparable_rewire/D3_N32_r0.03_s42 (not comparable to canonical runs).
- Full-resolution RGG r=0.03 attempt (n_sigma=300, 55 probes) ran ~18 min but was killed by host (signal 9). Need higher resource quota or checkpointing to finish heavy SLQ runs.
- Attempted RGG r=0.05 with reduced grids (n_sigma 120→40) but host continued to kill runs; no usable artifacts beyond the tiny r=0.05 try.
- Tiny-grid RGG sweep for r=0.05 (n_sigma=30, 5 C_geo steps, 10 probes) completed; acceptance failed, staircase inverted, but artifacts now exist under outputs/nonseparable_rewire/D3_N32_r0.05_s42.
- Multiple extremely coarse r=0.05 RGG runs (n_sigma=60→30) completed, all failing criteria; final artifacts represent the 30-point grid (C_geo=[0.05…1.0]) with family=rgg, radius≈0.20.
