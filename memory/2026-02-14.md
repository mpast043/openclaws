- Added docs/TRIAD_MAPPING.md to anchor the Framework triad (M, ω, U) and depth truncation π_n directly to `dimshift` objects, so future capacity axes and observer modules have a canonical mapping.
- Updated the capacity sweep plumbing to carry full Framework capacity vectors (C_geo, C_int, C_gauge, C_ptr, C_obs) through SweepConfig, SweepResult, metadata, and ds_matrix.json, enabling multi-axis experiments without further rewrites.
- Built scripts/analyze_capacity_run.py to compute Sec. 3.5 class-splitting diagnostics (N(C), R_γ) from any sweep artifact; generated class_splitting.csv for the 20260214T191825_9200c99e0f29 run (peak R_γ ≈ 4.37 at C_geo ≈ 0.672).
- Re-ran the historic gap_quantile experiment with the new plumbing; results still hit a power-law regime at q_int = 0.02 (R²_power ≈ 0.999 ≥ R²_exp ≈ 0.996), with refreshed artifacts under outputs/gap_quantile/.
