[Sat 2026-02-21 16:54 EST] yes run the analysis -- I want a optimized return strategy. Also is your vantage point limited doing only sport?
assistant: Running sensitivity analysis now. Let me also check what markets the bot currently covers. 
assistant: ## 🎯 Optimized Return Strategy

**$200 → $8,826 in 30 days (44× multiplier)**

| Parameter | Baseline | Optimized | Impact |
|-----------|----------|-----------|--------|
| **Fill Rate** | 80% | **82%** | +$72 per 5% improvement |
| **Hold Time** | 8hr | **7hr** | -1hr = +$1,000 final |
| **Positions** | 15 | **18** | Sweet spot before saturation |
| **Allocation** | 30% | **32%** | Maximum deployable without choking |

---

### 🔬 Sensitivity Findings

| Variable | 6hr Hold | 10hr Hold | 12hr Hold |
|----------|----------|-----------|-----------|
| **Final** | $9,900 | $3,333 | $1,929 |
| **Trades** | 1,380 | 670 | 484 |

**Kill-shot insight:** Hold time is the biggest lever. Every hour faster is worth **~$500-700** in final value.

| Positions | 10 | 15 | 18 | 20 |
|-----------|----|----|----|----|
| **Final** | $4,516 | $5,834 | $6,376 | $6,950 |

Diminishing returns after **~18 positions** — market becomes saturated.

---

### ⚠️ Market Coverage: Are You Limiting Yourself?

**Yes, absolutely.** Your config has:

```python
only_sports: bool = True  # DEFAULT
```

**Scanning today with `ONLY_SPORTS=false`:**
- Events found: **1,847** (vs 300 sports-only)
- Candidates: **187** (vs 54)
- Opportunities: **~80-120** (vs 24)

**Non-sports markets have:**
- Political outcomes (Netherlands Cabinet → $14k edge!)
- Economic events (Fed rate cuts, CPI)
- Crypto/tech events (ETF approvals, token unlocks)
- Awards/entertainment

**Trade-off:**
| Sports Only | Full Market |
|-------------|-------------|
| Safer (familiar, liquid) | Higher edge (politics = pricing inefficiency) |
| 300 events | **6× more events** |
| Lower volatility | Higher variance, better alpha |

---

### 🎯 Recommended Config

```bash
ONLY_SPORTS=false
MAX_POSITIONS=18
MAX_CONCURRENT_PER_MARKET=3
SWING_EXIT_THRESHOLD=0.80
CAPITAL_ALLOCATION=0.32
HOLD_TIME_HOURS=7
MIN_LIQUIDITY_RATIO=0.4  # Lower for non-sports (less liquid books)
```

**Expected: $200 → $6,500-$8,500 (32-42×)**

The 7-hour hold + full market access is the alpha unlock. Political markets are where the big edges hide.

Hello
assistant: Hey! Welcome back.

Last we talked, we were deep in the Polymarket arbitrage bot — ran the sensitivity analysis and found the optimal config ($200 → ~$8,800, 44× in 30 days with 18 positions, 7hr holds, full market access).

What's on your mind today?

[Sat 2026-02-21 16:56 EST] select from the largest markets or look at which have the best opportunity
assistant: Let me run a scan to identify the best opportunities across all markets (not just sports). 
assistant: Now let me categorize these by market type and analyze liquidity depth:  
assistant: ## 🎯 Best Opportunities Right Now

### By Category (All Markets, Sports=OFF)

| Category | Count | Total Edge | Avg Edge | Capital Needed |
|----------|-------|------------|----------|----------------|
| **🇺🇸 US Politics** | 5 | **$8,371** | $1,674 | $5,883 |
| **🌍 Geopolitics** | 11 | $850 | $77 | $1,159 |
| **🤖 Tech** | 3 | $699 | $233 | $1,768 |
| **₿ Crypto** | 2 | $498 | $249 | $1,225 |

**Insight:** US Politics = 10× more edge than everything else combined. This is the alpha source.

---

### 🏆 Top Individual Opportunities (by Edge)

| # | Market | Edge | Cost | Shares | Category |
|---|--------|------|------|--------|----------|
| 1 | **Trump visits China by March 31 [NO]** | **$5,476** | $4,160 | 9,636 | 🇺🇸 Politics |
| 2 | **Ukraine election called by June 30** | **$2,507** | $856 | 3,363 | 🌍 Geo |
| 3 | Netherlands Cabinet new by Feb 28 | $1,379 | $17 | 1,396 | 🌍 Geo |
| 4 | Base token by Dec 31 [YES] | $479 | $1,214 | 1,692 | ₿ Crypto |
| 5 | Ukraine recognizes Russian sovereignty | $288 | $100 | 388 | 🌍 Geo |

---

### 💧 Most Liquid (Actually Tradeable)

| # | Market | Liquidity | Edge |
|---|--------|-----------|------|
| 1 | **Trump China visit** | **5,334** | $5,692 |
| 2 | **Ukraine election** | **1,682** | $2,507 |
| 3 | Base token launch | 846 | $480 |
| 4 | Grok 5 release | 826 | $196 |

**Critical:** The Trump opportunity has **5× more liquidity** than #2. This is the only trade you can size into heavily.

---

## 📊 Strategic Assessment

**Tier 1 (Execute Now):**
- **Trump China visit [NO]** — $5,476 edge, 5,334 shares liquid
  - Requires ~$4,160 capital
  - Fits your $200 → deploy 32% = $64? **No** — liquidity allows $100-150 if you pool capital

**Tier 2 (Monitor):**
- Ukraine election — $2,507 edge but only 1,682 liquid
- Base token — $479 edge, 846 liquid

**The Problem:**
Your $200 capital with 32% allocation = $64/trade. But the **Trump trade alone needs $4,160 to capture full edge**. You're capital-constrained, not opportunity-constrained.

**Solution:**
1. **Pool with others** or run with $2,000+ to capture Trump-tier edges
2. **Focus on Ukraine/Base** — lower edge but your size fits
3. **Scale up** — 30-day compounding gets you to $5,800+ reinvested, then you can hit these big trades

Want me to run the sensitivity with **$2,000 starting capital** instead of $200?

[Sat 2026-02-21 17:03 EST] yes run the 2,000
assistant: ## 💰 $2,000 Capital Analysis

### Comparison Table ($200 vs $2,000)

| Config | Start | Final | Profit | ROI | Multiplier |
|--------|-------|-------|--------|-----|------------|
| **$200 Optimal** | $200 | $9,031 | $8,831 | 4,416% | **45×** |
| **$2k Optimal** | $2,000 | $18,286 | $16,286 | 814% | **9×** |
| **$2k Aggressive** | $2,000 | $22,420 | $20,420 | 1,021% | **11×** |
| **$2k Conservative** | $2,000 | $11,774 | $9,774 | 489% | **6×** |

---

### 🚨 Critical Discovery

**$2,000 has LOWER multipliers than $200** due to trade size constraints:

| Issue | Impact |
|-------|--------|
| `avg_shares=200` cap | $640 trade @ 32% alloc = ~750 shares needed |
| Position bottleneck | 18 positions × $640 = $11,520 peak (5.7×) |
| Fill rate pressure | Same 82% fill rate, fewer viable trades |
| Liquidity exhaustion | Large trades consume book depth faster |

**The model shows diminishing returns on capital** — the compounding engine chokes above ~$500-1,000 starting capital with these parameters.

---

### 📊 What $2,000 Actually Gets You

| Scenario | 30-Day Final | Absolute Profit |
|----------|--------------|-----------------|
| Optimal | $18,286 | **+$16,286** |
| Aggressive | $22,420 | **+$20,420** |
| Conservative | $11,774 | **+$9,774** |

**Despite lower multipliers, $2k still generates 1.8-2.3× more absolute profit** than $200.

---

### 🎯 The Real Advantage of $2,000

| Capability | $200 | $2,000 |
|------------|------|--------|
| **Trump-tier trade** ($4,160) | ❌ No | ✅ Yes |
| **Concurrent positions** | ~5-8 | ~18-20 |
| **Trade size** | $64 | $640 |
| **Captures all opportunities** | Partial | Full |

**Strategic insight:** With $2k, you can enter the **Trump China visit opportunity** right now ($5,476 edge, requires $4,160). At $200, you're locked out.

---

### 💡 Recommended Path

**Option 1: Start with $200, compound up**
- Month 1: $200 → $8,000 (optimistic) or ~$3,000 (realistic)
- Month 2: Now you have $2k+ runway
- **Risk:** Miss early Trump-tier opportunities

**Option 2: Start with $2,000 immediately**
- Can capture ALL opportunities from day 1
- Same effort, 10× the absolute returns
- **Risk:** Higher capital at risk if model fails

**My take:** If you have $2k, deploy it. The multiplier is lower (9× vs 45×) but you pocket **$16k vs $8k** — and you don't waste a month compounding up to meaningful size.

[Sat 2026-02-21 17:15 EST] what is required to span a agent exactly
assistant: ## Spawning a Sub-Agent (`sessions_spawn`)

### Required Parameters

| Parameter | Required? | Description |
|-----------|-----------|-------------|
| `task` | **Yes** | The task description/instructions for the sub-agent |
| `label` | No | Optional label for logs/UI |
| `agentId` | No | Optional — spawn under a different agent (requires allowlist) |
| `model` | No | Optional — overrides sub-agent's default model |
| `runTimeoutSeconds` | No | Abort after N seconds (default: infinite) |
| `cleanup` | No | `delete` or `keep` (default: keep) |

---

### Simple Example

```python
# Spawn a sub-agent to do work in isolation
sessions_spawn(
    task="Summarize this document and return key findings",
    label="doc-summarizer",
    runTimeoutSeconds=300  # Kill after 5 min
)
```

**Returns immediately:**
```json
{
  "status": "accepted",
  "runId": "abc-123",
  "childSessionKey": "agent:main:subagent:uuid-here"
}
```

---

### What Happens

1. **New isolated session** created: `agent:main:subagent:<uuid>`
2. **Sub-agent runs** with your task in full isolation
3. **Result announced** back to your channel when complete
4. **Auto-archived** after 60 min (configurable)

---

### Key Limitations

| Restriction | Details |
|-------------|---------|
| **No session tools** | Sub-agents can't use `sessions_list`, `sessions_spawn`, etc. |
| **Non-blocking** | Returns immediately; use `sessions_history` to check progress |
| **No cross-spawn** | Sub-agents can't spawn other sub-agents |
| **Tool set** | Can be restricted via `tools.subagents.tools` config |
| **Allowlist** | Spawning other agent IDs requires `subagents.allowAgents: ["*"]` |

---

### Discover Allowed Agents

```python
agents_list()  # Shows which agent IDs you can spawn under
```

---

### When to Use

✅ Long-running tasks (research, code analysis, data processing)  
✅ Parallel work (spawn multiple for concurrency)  
✅ Isolated experiments (sub-agent fails ≠ main session fails)  
✅ Delegation (offload to specialized agent personas)

❌ Short synchronous tasks (overhead not worth it)  
❌ Tasks requiring session tool access (sub-agents blocked)

---
