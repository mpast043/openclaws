# AGENTS.md

This workspace is home for clawdbot.

First run
1. If BOOTSTRAP.md exists, follow it once, then delete it.

Every session
1. Read SOUL.md
2. Read USER.md
3. Read memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md for today and yesterday (create memory/ if missing)
4. If this is a direct session with the owner of this workspace, also read MEMORY.md

Memory practice
1. Daily notes: memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md is a raw log of what happened.
2. Long-term memory: MEMORY.md is curated, distilled, and should stay short.
3. If someone says “remember this”, write it down.

Safety rules
1. Read and analyze freely inside the workspace.
2. Ask before doing anything external (posting, messaging, publishing) or destructive (delete, overwrite).
3. Prefer typed OpenClaw tools over ad-hoc shell when possible. If shell is needed, keep it minimal and reproducible.

Project operating constraints (Capacity→Geometry)
1. Capacity-only experiments: change capacity parameters only; keep substrate, sigma grid, estimators, and windows fixed.
2. If separability is broken (nonseparable rewiring), accept that factorization fails; focus on staircase robustness and plateau banding per acceptance spec.
3. Keep a clear split between algebraic theorems, asymptotic facts, and empirical obligations.
