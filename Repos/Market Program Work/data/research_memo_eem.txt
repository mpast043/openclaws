SPECTRAL DIMENSION MARKET TEST — RESEARCH MEMO
==================================================

1. Does ds meaningfully change during crises?

   2008: mean ds = 0.7345
   Mar 2020: mean ds = 0.3186
   2022: mean ds = 0.8676
   Non-crisis mean ds = 0.9557

2. Is ds leading, coincident, or lagging (vs VIX)?

   Best lag: 13 days, corr = -0.2587 — ds leads VIX.

3. Is ds redundant with volatility?

   Correlation ds–VIX (lag 0): -0.2455. Low |r|: not strongly redundant with VIX.

4. Evidence of structural regime detection?

   Crisis vs non-crisis mean ds spread: 0.6370. Some difference.

5. Brutally honest summary

   ds shows some variation between crisis and non-crisis periods; inspect the plot.
   ds–VIX correlation (lag 0) is -0.245: low redundancy.
   Conclusion: This pipeline does not provide evidence that spectral dimension of
   rolling correlation networks detects structural market regime shifts.
