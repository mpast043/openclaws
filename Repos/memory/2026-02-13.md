- Built `scripts/run_gap_tail.py` per near-degenerate spec (two-cluster RGG, fixed C_geo=0.5, q_int=0.8, σ window as rgg400_q80, C_int ∈ {0,1}).
- Initial sweep (n=400, r=0.30, ε in [0.30, 0.005]) kept Δλ ≈ 97, Δd_s ≈ 0.055, R²_exp ≈0.99 > R²_power ≈0.81 for all ε — still rigid. Output: `capacity-demo/outputs/gap_tail/`.
- Added `scripts/run_gap_quantile.py` to collapse λ_int on the fixed rgg400 substrate (q_int sweep 0.8→0.02, same C_geo and σ window). Δλ fell to ~38 at q=0.02, Δd_s climbed to ~0.414, and the stop condition triggered when R²_power overtook R²_exp (power-law regime detected). Artifacts at `capacity-demo/outputs/gap_quantile/`.
