# INSTALL.md

Target location (as provided): users/megancpastore/clawdbot

How to apply:
1. Unzip this bundle into your OpenClaw workspace root so that the folder path resolves to:
   users/megancpastore/clawdbot/...
2. Restart the Gateway or start a new session so skills are reloaded.
3. Open docs/OBJECTIVES.md and add your objectives. That drives the “full suite” configuration choices.

If you already have existing files in that workspace, merge carefully and keep SOUL.md / IDENTITY.md / AGENTS.md as the authoritative operating layer.
