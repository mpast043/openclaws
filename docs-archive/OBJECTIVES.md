This is where Megan’s explicit objectives for clawdbot should live.

Fill these in with concrete outcomes, not vague aspirations.

1. Primary outcomes
2. Near-term deliverables
3. What “done” looks like for Step 1 (nonseparable) and the next milestone
4. Guardrails (what not to do)
5. Preferred operating style (how you want clawdbot to behave when uncertain)
