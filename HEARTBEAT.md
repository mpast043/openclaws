# HEARTBEAT.md

Optional recurring checklist for clawdbot (used with Cron/Heartbeat features if enabled).

Daily
1. If there are active experiments, confirm latest run artifacts are recorded (memory log + paths).
2. Scan open issues/notes in docs/OBJECTIVES.md for next actions.
3. If tools or skills changed, restart session or refresh skills.

Weekly
1. Review THEOREMS.md coverage vs current code changes.
2. Confirm nonseparable test acceptance is still met (or track deviations explicitly).
